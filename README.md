This container includes the city, date and time, current temp, current weather conditions, current wind speed, and current humidty. The second container is a suggested news article based on the location search. There is a desciription of the news article and a link to the whole article on a third party site. The third container lists all the previous cities searched as well as a clear history button. This container allows you to click on a previous searched city and get the current weather as well as clearing all the previously searched histories. At the bottom of the page is an interactive radar map that pulls up the location that was searched.
